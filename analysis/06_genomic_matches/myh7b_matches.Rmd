# Purpose 

Gene knockouts can have more mild effects than gene knockdowns. One potential mechanism of compensation has recieved some attent last year, which is that gene mutations that truncate the encoded protein can trigger the expression of related genes in a process termed nonsense-induced transcriptional compensation.

In cardiac and skeletal muscle, exon 7 is skipped in MYH7b, leading to a premature termination codon. Since this skipped-exon transcript is both expressed and present in the nucleus in our model system (hiPSC-CMs), it's possible that this transcriptional compensentation mechanism is active. 

### Upon MYB7b knockdown 3x more genes are downregulated than upregulated 

In our MYH7b knockdown experiment, there were more downregulated than upregulated genes and the mean log2FoldChange for the downregulated genes is higher as well. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# MYH7B KD results
res <- read.csv("lnc_myh7b_aso_kd_vs_aso_ctl_all.csv")

res_sig <- res %>% filter(padj < 0.05)
res_sig$direction <- "upregulated"
res_sig[which(res_sig$log2FoldChange < 0), "direction"] <- "downregulated"

res_sig_summary <- res_sig %>% group_by(direction) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), mean_l2FC = mean(log2FoldChange))


g <- ggplot(res_sig_summary, aes(x = direction, y = count, fill = direction)) 
g + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#a8404c","#424242"), guide = FALSE) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  ggtitle("MYH7b KD DEG padj < 0.05")

g <- ggplot(res_sig_summary, aes(x = direction, y = abs(mean_l2FC), fill = direction)) 
g + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#a8404c","#424242"), guide = FALSE) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  ggtitle("MYH7b KD DEG padj < 0.05")

```

This is consistent with transcriptional compensation being active and dependent on the amount of the MYH7b RNA expression level.

One hypothesis for how this transcriptional is targeted to genes that are upregulated is that segments of the RNA are bound by a chromatin modifying complex and directed to regions in the genome complementary to either the sense or antisense RNA. The complex can then activate transcription at that site. 

In order to assess whether the downregulated genes could potentially have been activated by this mechanism, we can see where MYH7b subsequences map throughout the genome using blast and then see if they overlap with the down-regulated regions. 

#### Promoter-region overlaps

Using blast with permissive parameters, such that matches down to 18 bp in length are returned, we can get a good idea of where the MYH7b RNA may have complementarity in the genome.

The get a total of 1803 matches in hg38, ranging in length from 18 to 400 bp. The longer segments are of course mapping to the gene's locus itself. The matches come from all along the MYH7b RNA. [TODO: if we want to pursue this, will need to filter out exon 7].

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Blast results were calculated with `blast_myh7b.sh` 
matches <- read.table("genomic_myh7b_matches_permissive.out")
colnames(matches) <- c("qaccver", "saccver", "pident", "length",

                       "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore", "sstrand")
# Convert to GRanges object
# - it will only take ranges where the end is larger than the start
matches <- matches %>%
  mutate(diff = sstart - send)
matches$start <- matches$sstart
matches$end <- matches$send

matches[which(matches$diff > 0), "start"] <- matches[which(matches$diff > 0), "send"]
matches[which(matches$diff > 0), "end"] <- matches[which(matches$diff > 0), "sstart"]
matches <- matches %>%
  mutate(new_diff_neg = (start - end) < 0)

granges_matches <- GRanges(seqnames = as(matches$saccver, "Rle"), 
                           ranges = IRanges(start = matches$start, end = matches$end))
granges_matches$query <- matches$qaccver
# This filtering has got to do with a weir issue with comparing genomes that
# don't have the same seqnames in regioneR
canonical_chrs <- unique(granges_matches@seqnames)[grep("chr",unique(granges_matches@seqnames))] %>%
  as.character()
granges_matches <- granges_matches[which(granges_matches@seqnames %in% canonical_chrs)]

matches <- matches %>% 
  arrange(evalue) %>%
  mutate(rank = 1:nrow(.))

### All the regions mapping to the MYH7b locus are mapping to the plus strand.
### this makes sense, becuase that is the strand the RNA is transcribed from.
